# Bridging the Cybersecurity Talent Gap Through On-The-Job Training

## Project Overview

This project aims to address the critical issue of the cybersecurity talent gap by proposing an on-the-job training program. The program is designed to bridge the divide between current hiring practices and the industry's evolving needs. By focusing on incident response training as a case study, this project demonstrates how targeted on-the-job training can effectively develop the necessary skills within the broader cybersecurity field.
